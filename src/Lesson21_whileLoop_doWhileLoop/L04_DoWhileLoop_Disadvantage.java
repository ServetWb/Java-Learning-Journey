            Advantage of Do-While Loop:
                The loop body runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

            Disadvantage of Do-While Loop:
                The loop body runs at least once, even if it shouldn't.

            For example, in the task below:
            If the user enters 0, ideally the loop body should not run at all.
            However, because the `do` block executes before the `while` condition is checked,
            it prints 0 even though it shouldnâ€™t.
