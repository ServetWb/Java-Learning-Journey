        Variables created within a code block are called LOCAL VARIABLES.
        1- Local variables can only be used within the code block where they are created.
        2- You CANNOT declare two variables with the same name in the same code block.
           Different code blocks can have variables with the same name;
           each variable is valid only within its own code block.
        3- Loops also have their own scopes { },
           and the scope of a variable created inside a loop
           is between the loopâ€™s { }, and it cannot be used outside the loop.
        4- Variables created inside the main method
           can also be used inside loops created within the main method.
